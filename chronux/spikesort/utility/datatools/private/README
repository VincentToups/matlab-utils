
The functions in this directory encapsulate computation-intensive utilities.

    * All core functions are named 'CORE_xxxx.m'.

    * These functions are not intended to be called directly from the
	command line, as they are written for maximum efficiency and not
 	guaranteed to perform any error checking on their arguments.  They
 	should be called only from wrapper M files that verify syntax and
 	trap error conditions (if possible).

    * Many of these functions have a MEX equivalent of the same name for
	further efficiency.  These MEX functions are also not guaranteed
	to perform any error checking and may crash Matlab if they are
	called incorrectly.  All MEX implementations have an equivalent
	.m function for documentation and to provide an alternative for
	situations in which MEX is inconvenient.

    * Much of the MEX code is centralized in the file CORE_library.c

    * All MEX implementations were written in a Windows environment, but
	the computational code should in general be directly portable to
	other platforms.


The following provides a typical example of the structure of these files:

	Matlab native code only:
			         Matlab code:   minmax.m
... calls ...		CORE utility:   CORE_minmax.m

	With MEX in Windows:
			       Matlab code:     minmax.m
... calls ...		   MEX dll:     CORE_minmax.dll
... compiled from ...	C code:     CORE_minmax.c
... uses code from ...	C code:     CORE_library.c
