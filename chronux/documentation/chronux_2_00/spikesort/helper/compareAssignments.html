<div class="fragment"><pre class="comment"> COMPAREASSIGNMENTS   Computes a quality measure of the similarity between assignments.

 [score, scoreIfIndependent] = compareAssignments(assignments1, assignments2)
     The inputs, 'assignments1' and 'assignments2', must be two column vectors of
     the same length where each row contains an integer category label for the
     corresponding sample.  The integer labels used in the assignment vectors need
     have no intrinsic meaning (in particular, e.g., category 1 in 'assignments1'
     has no relationship to category 1 in 'assignments2').

     The first output, 'score', is a scalar between 0 and 1 that measures the
     similarity between the two classifications.  A 'score' of 1 implies perfect
     correspondance, ignoring actual labels.  For example, if all samples in
     'assignments1' are labelled by 1 and relabelled as 2 in 'assignments2', the
     'score' would be 1.  Deviations from this correspondance are penalized in a
     a fashion that recognizes category splitting/merging and penalizes these less
     than completely random redistribution.

     The algorithm is motivated by a Chi^2 two-way classification; however, here we
     return a similarity score rather than simply testing the hypothesis that the
     classifications are independent.  The expected score if the classifications
     were independent is returned as the second output, 'scoreIfIndependent', with
     the standard Chi^2 two-way p-value returned as an optional third output (this
     requires the statistics toolbox).  This p-value represents the probability that
     the two assignments were independent.

     Conceptually (though not computationally), the algorithm considers all N*(N-1)
     pairs of data samples and counts pairs that cosegregate, where a pair of samples
     is defined as cosegregating if they either share the same category in both
     assignments or if they do not share category in either assignment.  For example,
     consider the following assignments:
            sample #          assignments1         assignments2
               1                   1                     2
               2                   1                     2
               3                   2                     3
               4                   1                     3
     The pairs (1,2) and (1,3) cosegregate while the pair (1,4) does not (since they
     share a label in 'assignments1' but not in 'assignments2').  'score' is the fraction
     of pairs that cosegregate between the two assignments.

     (An optional third boolean input argument 'showTables' (default 0) produces a graphical
     output with the contingency table, conditional probabilities and marginals for the
     assignments.  The 'score' described above is calculated efficiently using these matrices).</pre></div>
