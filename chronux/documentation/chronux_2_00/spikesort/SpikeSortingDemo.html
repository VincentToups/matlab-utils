%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% INTRO %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The sorting procedure itself is fairly easy to perform (although it is
%  currently mostly command line driven -- not much GUI yet -- and you 
%  have to perform your own spike detection to create the inputs described
%  below).  Automated spike sorting, however, always requires a human
%  'sanity check' and can sometimes also need intervention.  To this end,
%  several visualization tools are included.  This file steps through an
%  extended example of their use.
%
% We start with an overview of how to sort if you want to get started
%  quickly.  This is followed by example code and example data which
%  will hopefully clarify the details.  The example does not, however,
%  cover everything that the code can do . . . if there is something that
%  you feel is not working or information that you feel would be useful,
%  please feel free to look at the code itself (which is fully documented)
%  and to use HELP.  (or email sbmehta@ucsd.edu)
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% OVERVIEW %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The input to the sorting code is a Matlab structure with the following
%  fields:    {WAVEFORMS, SPIKETIMES, FS, THRESHT, THRESHV}
%     WAVEFORMS is an N x M matrix of spike data, where each row contains
%      the voltage values from a single spike (this can be from a single
%      electrode or e.g., the concatenated data from a tetrode).  More
%      generally, any feature (not necessarily voltage) can appear in this
%      matrix, although it is your responsibility to make sure that they
%      are normalized such that differing units between features do not
%      dominate the variance of the data.
%     SPIKETIMES is an N x 1 vector of spike times (in seconds).  The nth
%      entry should correspond to the nth row of 'waveforms'.
%     FS is the sampling rate (in Hz) of the recording.
%     THRESHT is the column index in WAVEFORMS where threshold crossing
%      occurred (i.e., we are assuming the the spikes were extracted from a
%      raw data trace via threshold detection).  For example, if the THRESHT
%      is 10 and WAVEFORMS is N x 30, then the 10th column of WAVEFORMS
%      contains the sample that crossed threshold, with 9 samples before and
%      20 samples after.  The threshold detection must be done in such a way
%      that no two detected spikes are ever less than M samples apart.
%     THRESHV is a pair of numbers corresponding to the high and low voltage
%      thresholds used to extract the spikes.  If only one threshold was used,
%      the other can be given as +/- Inf.  For example, [-50, Inf] means that
%      spikes were detected when the voltage dropped below -50 (arbitrary units)
%      and no positive going threshold was defined.
%  The WAVEFORMS, SPIKETIMES and FS are required.  The code will run
%   if THRESHT and THRESHV are not defined, but the dejittering step will
%   not work and the height/width graphical displays may produce errors.
%  Sorting options can also be defined in the SPIKES structure to direct the
%   algorithm.  The currently defined options are:
%     SPIKES.OPTIONS.OUTLIER_CUTOFF     (see help for SS_OUTLIERS)
%     SPIKES.OPTIONS.REFRACTORY_PERIOD  (see help for SS_AGGREGATE)
%   These are not mandatory; if not defined, default values are used.
%
% The end product of the sorting is an N x 1 vector of assignments, with any
%   outliers assigned to a cluster with label 0.  If you prefer to have the
%   outliers segregated from the data, see HELP SS_AGGREGATE; in this case,
%   the assignment vector will be of size P x 1, where P is the number of
%   spikes not treated as outliers, and the WAVEFORMS and SPIKETIMES variables
%   will also be modified to have P rows.  The remaining spikes (i.e., the
%   outliers) can then be found in a new field called OUTLIERS.
%   The assignments are numerical labels with no inherent meaning; their only
%   interpretation is that spikes labeled with, e.g., 1 belong to the same cluster.
%
% If the input information is collected into a Matlab structure called 'spikes',
%  the following code will produce the output assignments vector:
          spikes = ss_dejitter(spikes);
          spikes = ss_outliers(spikes);
          spikes = ss_kmeans(spikes);
          spikes = ss_energy(spikes);
          spikes = ss_aggregate(spikes);
          assignments = spikes.hierarchy.assigns;
%
% If this seems cryptic, read on ...
%
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% STEP-BY-STEP %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The above code will sort the spikes but provides little feedback along
%  the way.  Until this is all wrapped into a GUI, effective sorting requires
%  the use of the included command line tools to give you a sense for how
%  the data look.  Note that this some of these steps might be easier to
%  follow if you browse through the Fee et al. paper first.
%
% If you have put your own data into a 'spikes' data structure as described
%  above, you can run the code on your own data.  This code, however, includes
%  three demonstration data sets chosen to highlight the functionality.  i
%  suggest that that you try one of these data sets first to make sure that
%  things run the same on your computer as they do on mine.</pre></div>
